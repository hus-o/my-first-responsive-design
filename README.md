# my-first-responsive-design
## Huseyin & Igor
### What I/we have learned:
### We've learnt the basics of the Bootstrap framework and how to align elements using flexbox
### What challenges I/we overcame:
### A challenge we came up against was aligning a paragraph and image side-by-side and center of page. We slowly figured out how to do this by constricting the width of the elements and adding it to a flex enabled parent container.
### What I/we struggled with:
### Making the site entirely responsive across a majority of sizes. It worked very well on some but a but horribly on others. Also trying to align 2 elements (image and heading), one central and another to the very left. Still haven't implemented this.

### What I/we would do differently next time:
### Try another framework or none
